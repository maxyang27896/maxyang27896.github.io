I am a PhD student at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/), under the supervision of Prof. [David Barton](https://cityinthesky.co.uk/about-me/) and Prof. [Nathan Lepora](https://lepora.com/). My current research is on sim-to-real deep reinforcement learning for robot manipulation at the [Dexterous Robotics Group](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/dexterous-robotics). My research interests lie in machine learning methods for robot perception and control. 

Previously, I worked as a R&D Engineer at [Sagentia Innovation](https://www.sagentiainnovation.com/) where I developed software tools for various engineering consultancy projects. Before that, I obtained my MEng degree in Aeronatical Engineering at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). My final year thesis was on the application of optimal control for cancer treatment.

<!-- I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford AI Lab, generously supported by Stanford Graduate Fellowship as a Pierre and Christine Lamond Fellow.

I was a Master's student in Machince Learning Department and a student researcher in Robotics Institute at CMU, advised by Deepak Pathak and Jitendra Malik. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Applied Math at UCLA, advised by Song-Chun Zhu.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Robotics and Computer Vision. I care about robot performance in the open world. In my free time, I enjoy cycling. -->

<!-- I am a Ph.D. Candidate at UC Berkeley advised by Prof. Yi Ma and Prof. Jitendra Malik. I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) advised by Prof. Chi-Keung Tang. I also spent two years in Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) where I was a research intern advised by Dr. Jifeng Dai and Dr. Yichen Wei. -->
